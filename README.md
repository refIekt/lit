# Lit CLI

*Shine a light on terminal commands.* ðŸ”¥

Lit lets you view metadata generated by [Reflekt](https://reflekt.dev) (and others) as a process runs.

## Usage

Simply start a command with `lit`. For example `rails server` becomes:
```
lit rails server
```

Running a script like `ruby script.rb` becomes:
```
lit ruby script.rb
```

## Installation

Applications using the Lit API should install the `lit` command for you. To install it manually run:
```
gem install lit-cli
```

## API

To integrate your application see the [Lit API](https://github.com/lit-cli/lit-api).
