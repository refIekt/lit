*Shine a light on terminal commands.* ðŸ”¥

Lit lets you view metadata generated by [Reflekt](https://reflekt.dev) (and others) as a process runs.

## Usage

Simply start any command with `lit`. For example `rails server` becomes:
```
lit rails server
```

A script like `ruby script.rb` becomes:
```
lit ruby script.rb
```

## Installation

Applications using the Lit API should install the `lit` command for you. To install it manually run:
```
gem install lit-cli
```

## Flags

Lit accepts flags to modify behaviour. They are prefixed with an `@` and added directly after the `lit` command:
```
lit @flag ruby script.rb --verbose
```

Lit flags start with an `@` instead of a `--` so that they aren't confused with flags for the command Lit is firing off.

### Status

Filter logs by status:
```
lit @status=error ruby script.rb
```

### Delay

Delay the execution of a program to make logs easier to read. The default delay is `0` seconds (no delay) but could be 1 second, for example:
```
lit @delay=1 ruby script.rb
```

## API

Instructions for integrating your application with Lit.

### Usage

At the top of your file add:
```ruby
require 'lit-cli'
include Lit
```

Then use the `lit()` method:
```ruby
lit "message"
```

### Installation

In Gemfile add:
```ruby
gem 'lit-cli'
```  

In terminal run:
```
bundle install
```

Or:
```
gem install lit-cli
```
